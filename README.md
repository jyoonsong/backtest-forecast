| **How much will core PCE increase in July 2025?** | 1. Economists widely agree that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation in July 2025 was expected to rise 0.3% month-over-month, slightly higher than the June rate of 0.26%. Tariff-related inflationary pressures and goods price increases contributed to this trend. While core PCE annual rate was predicted to increase to 2.9% from 2.8%, the monthly growth rate appeared steady at 0.3%. Such figures align with the Bureau of Economic Analysis consensus data and economist reviews【3:0†source】【3:1†source】【3:2†source】.<br><br>2. The underlying inflation model indicated steady month-to-month pressures from tariffs driving the inflation rate. Key factors included higher costs for consumer goods, services, and shelter indexes. Though some economists speculate that the inflation caused by tariffs may eventually stabilize, July's inflation remained above the Federal Reserve target of 2%, reflecting persistent upward trends【3:0†source】【3:2†source】.<br><br>3. Goldman Sachs forecasts for July core inflation also fell within the predicted range of 0.3% monthly increments, projecting a consistent upward spiral driven by external trade policies impacting consumer pricing. Meanwhile, other financial institutions, including BofA, offered similar figures confirming 0.3% growth in core metrics aligned with consensus【3:2†source】【3:3†source】.<br><br>4. Economic reports coming before late August further emphasized robust upward trends in July inflation as driven by national policy factors and post-pandemic residual bracketing between goods/resolution shifts.

| **Will any Texas House Democrat be arrested in Aug 2025?** | Texas Democrats defied Republican efforts by not attending a legislative session on August 8, 2025, aimed at voting on a redistricting plan that would increase Republican congressional seats. In response, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton expressed a willingness to target those who remain absent from the state for contempt and indicated plans for potential civil arrests. While some Democrats expressed a readiness to return pending agreements on various issues, Governor Greg Abbott has pursue lawsuits to remove absent Democrats from their posts and threaten the legitimacy of their seats. This situation resulted in civil warrants being sought for multiple Democrats who left the state to avoid voting on the proposed congressional maps. (ABC News, August 8, 2025, https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/texas-democrats-face-republican-deadline-stop-standoff-face/story?id=124480936)<br><br>The Texas House took action to issue civil arrest warrants on August 4, 2025, for over 50 Democratic lawmakers who left the state to break quorum in order to block the passage of a new congressional map. The warrants allow for arresting these legislators only within Texas state lines, making them largely symbolic as most absentees relocated to states like Illinois and New York. A similar tactic was previously attempted in 2021, when an injunction was upheld against such warrants, indicating an ongoing legal battle over quorum rules. The House's move signaled an escalating conflict between the parties over redistricting efforts. (Texas Tribune, August 4, 2025, https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/04/texas-democrats-house-warrants-arrest-quorum-break/)<br><br>Governor Abbott issued direct orders for the arrest of Texas Democrats on August 4, 2025, after they failed to comply with a deadline to return to the legislative session. He criticized their absence as un-Texan and accused them of abandoning their duties. Abbott outlined potential consequences, suggesting the removal of seats for non-compliance and claiming that their absence was obstructing critical legislation. The legislative standoff has drawn national attention due to its implications on congressional balance and has prompted Abbott to mobilize state authorities to ensure the return of the absent Democrats. (Fox 4 News, August 4, 2025, https://www.fox4news.com/news/abbott-orders-arrest-democrats-legislative-standoff)<br><br>The ongoing standoff between Texas Republicans and Democrats continued as the Texas House failed to achieve quorum for a third time by August 11, 2025. This was notable because a series of Democratic lawmakers had traveled to different states, while Republican officials expressed increasing frustration at their absence from legislative duties. Amid this dynamic, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed lawsuits aiming to remove specific House Democrats from office. The contention largely centers around the potential redistricting plan, which Democrats argue is discriminatory while Republicans assert that Democrats are not fulfilling their legislative responsibilities. (CBS News, August 11, 2025, https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-legislative-standoff-continues-lawsuits-state-house-democrats-protesting-redistricting-proposal/)<br><br>On August 4, 2025, the Texas House voted to track down and arrest Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to prevent quorum, impacting legislative processes. The arrests resulted in warrants that empowered law enforcement to detain lawmakers, though the warrants are symbolic due to jurisdiction limits. The absence of Democrats is being leveraged as a political tool to force their return and resume critical legislative work amid a session focused on redistricting, previously initiated due to significant Republican pressure. The situation reflects ongoing tensions associated with the state’s political landscape and governance dynamics. (KRGV, August 4, 2025, https://www.krgv.com/news/texas-house-votes-to-track-down-arrest-democratic-lawmakers-who-left-the-state) | 0.17 | Civil arrest warrants were issued by the Texas House in early August 2025, but they were only enforceable within Texas; most absent Democrats remained out of state. Past precedent (e.g., 2021) suggests such warrants rarely result in actual detentions, and ongoing legal challenges further reduce the likelihood. While a brief detention upon return could count, the window before Sep 1, 2025 was short and incentives favored Democrats staying away. | GPT-5 | RAG Snapshot |
